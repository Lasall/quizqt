quizqt
======

Quiz application written in Qt


Compiling
---------

For compiling the program you must install Qt4 (v4.8 or later).

Then:

$ cd libquizqt
$ qmake
$ make
$ cd ..
$ qmake
$ make

Starting the program:

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./ ./quizqt


Adding questions
----------------

You can load a CSV-file in the app. The file should have this structure:

Category;Subcategory;Question;Answer;Points

See the file "quiz-example.csv" for an example.

It's possible to add a question to more than one category:

Category1,Category2;Subcategory;Question;Answer;Points

The "Points" must be one of 100, 200, 300 or 400.

Currently you need to have at least four questions for each point value
if you want to start a game.
